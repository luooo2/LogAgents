Based on the provided log file content, here is the parsed structure of the logs:

1. **Timestamp** (format: YYMMDD HHMMSS)
2. **Thread ID** (in milliseconds)
3. **Log Level** (e.g., INFO)
4. **Source component** (e.g., dfs.DataNode$PacketResponder)
5. **Log Message** (descriptive text)

### Sample Parsed Logs
1. **Log Entry**: 
   - **Timestamp**: 081109 203615
   - **Thread ID**: 148
   - **Log Level**: INFO
   - **Source**: dfs.DataNode$PacketResponder
   - **Message**: PacketResponder 1 for block blk_38865049064139660 terminating

2. **Log Entry**: 
   - **Timestamp**: 081109 204005
   - **Thread ID**: 35
   - **Log Level**: INFO
   - **Source**: dfs.FSNamesystem
   - **Message**: BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: 10.251.73.220:50010 is added to blk_7128370237687728475 size 67108864

### Anomaly Detection
From the given logs, let's analyze some potential anomalies:

1. **Terminating PacketResponders**:
   - There are multiple instances of PacketResponders terminating (e.g., blocks blk_38865049064139660 and blk_-6952295868487656571). An unusually high or sudden increase in the number of terminations over a short timeframe may signify a potential issue. 

2. **Packet Response Times**:
   - For instance, the response times for the PacketResponders vary significantly (e.g., 148 ms for one, while another takes 752 ms). A pattern that deviates greatly from the norm (e.g., a sudden increase or long latency after a regular interval) might indicate a load issue or other resource problems.

3. **Frequent Receiving of Blocks**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of receiving blocks from various sources. If one source unexpectedly sends a significantly higher number of blocks than typical, this could point to a problem or a misconfiguration.

4. **Log Messages with Large Variations**:
   - The sequence of logs, especially the message delivery times, varies greatly. Notably, entries like `BLOCK* NameSystem.allocateBlock` and `NameSystem.addStoredBlock` should be monitored for irregular intervals or sizes, particularly if combined with a high volume of data from a single or few sources.

### Conclusion
Further analysis requires the establishment of a baseline (normal behavior) for metrics like the number of terminations per time interval, average block receiving times, etc. Monitoring for sudden changes or pattern shifts involving these metrics can help identify potential operational issues or failures in the underlying systems.
